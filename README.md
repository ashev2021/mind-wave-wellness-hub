# Mind Wave App

## Project info


We're building a mobile app that uses real-time EEG data from wearable devices to detect early signs of anxiety and burnout—before they become overwhelming. By analyzing brainwave patterns like Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, we compute an intuitive anxiety score and notify users when intervention might be needed. The app also offers seamless access to mental health professionals through an integrated booking system. Our goal is to make mental health monitoring as continuous, objective, and accessible as checking your heart rate—bridging neuroscience and care to support well-being in everyday life.
